# Week 4 - Front End Development

In this branch you will find all the files for **week 4**.

I you have any questions, please let me know!!

## Exercise: Next.js & Supabase

In this exercise you will work with Next.js and Supabase (It is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that uses PostgreSQL). The goal is to
create a small web application in which you can display and manage
products.

### 1. Starting Point

Set up a new project or continue working in the existing ACME project.
(You can download: week-4-starter.zip).
Fetch the product data from the Fake Store API and insert it into the
products table in Supabase. Retrieve the following data from the API:
id, title, price, description & category. (Leave out the images for
now). After importing, you will have a populated database to work with.

If this doesn't work, I included the SQL code (products.sql), 
whioch you can use to create the table and insert the data. 
(Retry if it doesn't work the first time...).

### 2. From Fetch to Axios

In the previous session, you fetched products using fetch. This works fine when you just want to fetch data from an API-endpoint. Now switch to
axios and implement the full CRUD functionality: 
- **Create:** add new
products
- **Read:** retrieve and display products
- **Update:** modify
existing products
- **Delete:** remove products

### 3. Use of AI

You may use AI tools, for example to request a step-by-step plan or to
get ideas. Important: do not let AI build everything for you, as you
must understand how the code works.

### 4. Think of the User

Design your application with the end user in mind: 
- **Visitor side:**
an attractive product overview with a clear detail page. (We have
already built this).
- **Admin side:** an overview with the ability to
modify, add and delete products. (We are building this now and can add
authentication functionality later).

Tip: Keep the interface logical and user-friendly. Always ask yourself:
What works well for the user?

With this assignment, you combine front-end development (Next.js) with
back-end/database skills (Supabase) and learn how to set up a complete
web application with CRUD functionality. Good luck!
